# Livability Index Project using HPCC Systems

This project builds a **composite livability index** using HPCC Systems and ECL programming language. The objective is to analyze multiple datasets (crime, health, education, transportation, weather, population density, etc.) to compute various sub-scores and combine them into an overall livability score for different locations.
